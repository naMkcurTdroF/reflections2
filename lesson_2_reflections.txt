git init  --> creates a new repo from existing directory
git status --> shows me what files have changed since last commit
git add  --> add files to staging area

seems like staging area (i never hear people at work talk about it) helps not commit everything that's changed.
git commit -m "comment"  (i'd like to see how good the comments our team leaves are)
git commit (without '-m "my comment") opens my default editor to compose my commit comments
