Lesson 1 -
I guess this is interesting to try on my new system.
Some of it is slowing coming back.

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
  - easily. :)

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
  - pros: meaningful saves when a logical change is done. fewer versions. better tracking of related changes across other files.
  - cons: might forget to save and lose data.

What does using a VCS like git do to confidence in making changes that might result in a big break in functionality?
  - I know I can go back.
  - Encourage to experiment, sometimes bigger than before, with built-in documentation (as good as the commit comments are)
  - May make people make more commits --> why TWC needs to fix branching and merging and speed of commits
